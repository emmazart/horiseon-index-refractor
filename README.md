# Code Refactor Starter Code

User Story:
AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

Horiseon index.html has been refractored to meet the following criteria:
1. Meet accessibility standards by using semantic HTML elements, which follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
2. Image elements all use accessible alt attributes
3. All heading attributes fall in sequential order
4. Title element uses a concise, descriptive title
